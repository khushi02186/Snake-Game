# Snake-Game
The Snake Game with Java Swing is a classic and entertaining arcade game where players control a snake that moves around the screen, eating food to grow longer while avoiding collisions with its own tail. This implementation utilizes Java Swing to create a visually appealing and interactive gaming experience.
## Key Features:
* Snake Control:
  Navigate the snake using arrow keys or designated controls.
* Food Generation:
  Randomly generate food for the snake to eat and increase its length.
* Scoring:
  Keep track of the player's score, which increases with each food item consumed.
* Collision Detection:
  Implement collision detection to end the game if the snake hits itself.
* Game Over:
  Display a game-over screen with the player's score when the game ends.
